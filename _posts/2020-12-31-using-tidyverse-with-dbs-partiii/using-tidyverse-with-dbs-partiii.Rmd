## Recap

### Part I

In [Part I](https://sciencificity-blog.netlify.app/posts/2020-12-12-using-the-tidyverse-with-databases/) we made a connection to a SQLite Database (DB).

### Part II

In [Part II](https://sciencificity-blog.netlify.app/posts/2020-12-20-using-the-tidyverse-with-dbs-partii/) we progressed a bit further, with more in-depth `{dplyr}` workflows, and we also brought the data into R after doing most of the computation on the database itself.

# What are we tackling in Part III?

We're going to:

* Do a quick run through of setting up a MySQL database.
* Connect to the database using the __`Connections`__ Pane in RStudio, 
which is essentially a connection using an [ODBC Driver](https://www.progress.com/faqs/datadirect-odbc-faqs/what-is-an-odbc-driver).
* Leverage the MySQL DBMS to do the computation of the query on the database, instead of in R, bringing the aggregated data into R when needed. We will `collect()` (i.e. bring data into R when we're using functions that need the full dataset, not the "lazy result").

    - For visualisations using `ggplot`.
    - Some functions only work on data in a *dataframe like structure*, and can't work with
    the "lazy query" result. We will need to _collect()_ the data in this case to 
    proceed with our data pipeline e.g. _pivot_longer()_ as we will see later.

<aside>
`collect`ing data is when we bring the data into R. If you recall in the Part II post we pulled data into R when we had our aggregated data computed via a query we ran in the DBMS itself.
</aside>

The [project on GitHub](https://github.com/sciencificity/intro-to-dbs-r), has the code to setup the tables in the MySQL DB from R.

# Setup a MySQL DB

- We're going to set-up a local MySQL DB.
- We're going to use `{dplyr}`'s [`starwars`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/starwars.html) dataset. 
- We'll supplement this with survey data from a [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018/2018-05-14) dataset back in 2018, as well as some information on the franchise revenue also from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-07-02).


## Create a local MySQL instance

1. Go to the [MySQL page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) to download the appropriate server for you. I am on a Windows machine so I used the __MySQL Installer for Windows__.
1. Run through the setup.
1. Follow the setup steps - I installed a "Full version".
1. If you did not create your "root" user during the setup process (this happened to me), open the `MySQL Installer` from your machine's `Startup Menu`.

    a. Click `Reconfigure` next to __MySQL Server__.
    
        <img src="install1.JPG" 
       alt="Reconfigure MySQL Server in the Installer" 
       width="520" height="400">
     
    a. Check _Show Advanced and Logging Options_.
    a. Click __Next >__ to navigate the setup, which will ask you to setup a password for `root`.
    
        <img src="install2.JPG" 
       alt="Advanced Options allow you to set-up the root user" 
       width="520" height="400">
       
1. I opened `MySQL Workbench` and setup a user named `admin`, after connecting to the local host. It is good practise to keep your `root` user aside for security reasons, therefore creating other profiles to access the DB is advised.
1. I created a __"schema"__ by clicking on the little Database icon in `MySQL Workbench`

    a. Link is "Create a new schema in the connected server". 
    
       <img src="install3.JPG" 
       alt="Create schema in MySQL Workbench" 
       width="600" height="480">
     
    a. Alternately in the `MySQL Command Line Client` run:
    
      
      ```
      CREATE DATABASE starwars CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
      ```
      

That's it for the MySQL DBMS itself, the rest of the work for setting up our DB will be done in R.

## Our data

In the {dplyr} `r emoji::emoji("package")` we have a dataset <span style="color: #9d5a61;background-color:#efb087"><b>starwars</b></span> which has information for the characters.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# need to figure out what data is included
# in a package? 
# Call data(package = "pkg_name")
# which gives you a nice list of included datasets
data(package = "dplyr")
``` 

<img src="data_pkg.JPG" 
alt="Show data included in a package" width = "300">
       

Let's have a squizz at the [`starwars`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/starwars.html) dataset.

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
starwars
```

I broke this dataset apart to create different tables containing subsets 
of the information so we can practise on:

- <span style="color: #00203FFF;background-color:#ADEFD1FF">films</span>: contains information on the movies.
- <span style="color: #00203FFF;background-color:#ADEFD1FF">vehicles</span>: contains a listing on the vehicles in the movies.
- <span style="color: #00203FFF;background-color:#ADEFD1FF">starships</span>: contains a listing for the starships in the movies.
- <span style="color: #00203FFF;background-color:#ADEFD1FF">appearances</span>: which has a listing of each character against the film they appeared in.
- <span style="color: #00203FFF;background-color:#ADEFD1FF">vehicles_piloted</span>: has a listing of each character against the vehicle they drove.
- <span style="color: #00203FFF;background-color:#ADEFD1FF">starships_piloted</span>: has a listing of each character against the starship they piloted.
- <span style="color: #00203FFF;background-color:#ADEFD1FF">characters</span>: has information on each character for example their height, mass etc.
- <span style="color: #00203FFF;background-color:#ADEFD1FF">survey</span>: contains information from a survey run on the popularity of the Star Wars movies, characters etc.
- <span style="color: #00203FFF;background-color:#ADEFD1FF">survey_levels</span>: contains an id per character level rating e.g. _Very unfavorably_ was coded as `1`.
- <span style="color: #00203FFF;background-color:#ADEFD1FF">franchise</span>: contains the revenue of the franchise across different media - e.g. how much revenue comes from movies, merchandise etc.

```


## Create some tables

Here's an example of how I created the _films_, and the associated _appearances_ tables. 

```{r}
(films <- starwars %>%  
  # get the films column which contains lists of values
  select(films) %>% 
  # flatten the films list - this will create multiple rows for
  # each film in the list
  unnest(films) %>% 
  # get rid of duplicates
  distinct() )

film_years <- tribble(~name,      ~year,
        #------------------------#------
        "The Empire Strikes Back", 1980,
        "Revenge of the Sith"    , 2005,
        "Return of the Jedi"     , 1983,
        "A New Hope"             , 1977,
        "The Force Awakens"      , 2015,
        "Attack of the Clones"   , 2002,
        "The Phantom Menace"     , 1999)

films <- films %>% 
  # Join the tables to tag on the `year` column
  inner_join(film_years,
             # left table column = films, right table column = name
             by = c("films" = "name"))

# Order of films in terms of episodes, not release date
# We're going to use this to create a factor
film_levels <- c("The Phantom Menace", "Attack of the Clones", "Revenge of the Sith",
                 "A New Hope", "The Empire Strikes Back", "Return of the Jedi",
                 "The Force Awakens")
(films <- films %>% 
  # make "films" a factor using the film_levels we created above
  # this will ensure the id = 4 is associated to 'A New Hope'
  mutate(films = factor(films, film_levels),) %>% 
  # create an id column - we will use this later
  # the .before just says I want the id column to come before the films column
  mutate(id = as.integer(films), .before = "films") %>% 
  arrange(id))

(appearances <- starwars %>% 
  # let's save the characters appearances in the movies
  select(name, films) %>% 
  # we end up with {character_name, film} for every film the character appears in
  unnest(films) %>%
  # join it with our new films table
  inner_join(films) %>% 
  # select the id which we rename to film_id, and then the name of the character
  select(film_id = id, name))
```

If you'd like to follow along the RMarkdown file with all the code is [here](https://github.com/sciencificity/intro-to-dbs-r/blob/main/make_starwars_db.Rmd).

# `Connections` Pane 

1. In RStudio there is a `Connections` Pane. 
1. Create a `New Connection`.
1. Choose an appropriate driver (e.g. I chose `MySQL ODBC 8.0 Unicode Driver`).
1. If you struggle to figure out the parameters needed in the Popup window provided,
the [connectionstrings](https://www.connectionstrings.com/) website is a great help. 

    a. Choose the DBMS you're working with - in this case MySQL.
    a. Copy the connection string - in this case I used the [TCP Port](https://github.com/sciencificity/intro-to-dbs-r/blob/main/images/connection_string.gif) string.
    
1. Copy the connection string as per the connection strings website and paste it in the `Parameters` field. Amend the parameters such as `user name`, `password` etc. as per your instance. If you're using a corporate database, you need to use the IP Address provided by your Database Administrator as `Server`, same for your credentials etc.
1. Test the connection.
1. Copy the full string into the console / script you're working in.

## Make a connection

### ODBC

We use the connection string generated via the `Connections` Pane to connect
to our MySQL DB, and write our data frames into database tables.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(DBI)
# Make a connection
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), 
  .connection_string = "Driver={MySQL ODBC 8.0 Unicode Driver};
      Server=localhost;
      Port=3306;
      Database=starwars;
      Uid=admin;
      Pwd=Luke1@my0urf@ther;", 
    timeout = 10)

```

### Appropriate DBI-compliant package

We may alternatively use the appropriate DBI compliant package. ([RMariaDB::MariaDB()](https://db.rstudio.com/databases/my-sql/)).

<aside>DBI is the <b>D</b>ata<b>B</b>ase <b>I</b>nterface `r emoji::emoji("package")` for R. Instead of using an ODBC driver we may use one of the DBI compliant packages created by the R community to make a connection. In the case of MySQL we use `RMariaDB` `r emoji::emoji("package")`</aside>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Make a connection
con <- dbConnect(drv = RMariaDB::MariaDB(), 
                 host = "localhost", 
                 port = "3306",
                 user = "admin", 
                 password = "Luke1@my0urf@ther",
                 dbname = "starwars")
# Good housekeeping means disconnect
dbDisconnect(con)
```


## Writing to a MySQL Database from RStudio

Once we have connected to the database, we're ready to write our data frames into tables in the DBMS.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Write data frames we created to actual tables in the database
DBI::dbWriteTable(conn = con, 
                  "films", # name of table in database
                  films,   # the data frame
                  overwrite = TRUE) # if table exists overwrite it with this data
DBI::dbWriteTable(conn = con, "appearances",
                  appearances, overwrite = TRUE)
# Good housekeeping means disconnect
dbDisconnect(con)
```

# Communicate with our MySQL Database

Alright, we're all set now. We can now start to query our database tables in our MySQL DBMS.

## Connect

As before the first step is connecting.

```{r}
# Load libraries
library(DBI)
# Make a connection
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), 
  .connection_string = "Driver={MySQL ODBC 8.0 Unicode Driver};
      Server=localhost;
      Port=3306;
      Database=starwars;
      Uid=admin;
      Pwd=Luke1@my0urf@ther;", 
    timeout = 10)
dbListTables(con)
dbListFields(con, "characters")
```

## Take a look around

Let's get familiar with our data.

```{r}
tbl(con, "characters")
tbl(con, "films")
tbl(con, "appearances")
```

Connecting via the `Connections` Pane has some additional perks, in that you can
have a look at your tables as though you're in the DBMS itself. You may also 
preview the first 1000 rows.

## Explore data

Let's see if we can have a look at the popularity of the characters as per
the <span style="color: #00203FFF;background-color:#ADEFD1FF">survey</span> dataset.

The [TidyTuesday Star Wars survey dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2018/2018-05-14) we used, was based on this 
[FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-favorite-star-wars-movies-and-least-favorite-characters/).

```{r}
(svy_levels <- tbl(con, "survey_levels") %>% 
  collect())

(character_survey <- tbl(con, "survey") %>% 
  # Let's subset the rows to only those who claim they are fans of
  # the franchise
  filter(any_of_6 == "Yes", star_wars_fan == "Yes") %>% 
  # Let's only consider some columns
  select(`Han Solo`:`Yoda`, respondent_id,
         age = Age, respondent_gender = Gender) %>% 
  # we have to collect the data since the pivot_longer is
  # not set up to work on DB Table data
  collect() %>% 
  # Put each character name which is currently the name of a column
  # in a column as a value
  pivot_longer(cols = c(`Han Solo`:`Yoda`), names_to = "name",
               values_to = "survey_id") %>% 
  # Get the actual text of the response - e.g. Very Favorable
  inner_join(svy_levels,
             by = c("survey_id" = "id")))

# We want to only get the character info for the characters in the survey
# So we want to basically say `WHERE name IN (...)`
# This code is setting that up
characters <- character_survey %>% 
  select(name) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  mutate(name = str_glue("'{name}'")) %>% 
  as_tibble()
colnames(characters) <-  NULL
characters <- characters %>% as.list() %>% unlist()
characters <- characters %>%  paste(collapse =  ", ")
# Creating the WHERE name IN `(...)` part
(sql_code <- str_glue("({characters})"))

char_query <- tbl(con, "characters") %>% 
  inner_join(tbl(con, "appearances")) %>% 
  inner_join(tbl(con, "films"),
             by = c("film_id" = "id")) %>% 
  select(name, gender, homeworld, species, films, year) %>% 
  # Note here I use the special function `sql()` to directly 
  # insert a bit of SQL code in my pipeline
  filter(name %in% sql(sql_code)) 

char_query %>% 
  show_query()

(character_info <- character_survey %>%
  # we only want info for the characters that formed part of the survey
  left_join(char_query %>% 
              collect())) 


character_info <- character_info %>% 
  mutate(name = as.factor(name)) %>% 
  # Let's create aggregated survey levels by combining
  # Somewhat favorable and Very favourable into the Favourable category
  # We're essentially trimming down the categories as per the FiveThirtyEight
  # article
  mutate(sub_level = case_when(
   str_detect(level, "Neither favorably nor unfavorably")  ~  "Neutral",
   (str_detect(level, " unfavorably") |
      str_detect(level, "Somewhat unfavorably"))           ~  "Unfavourable",
   (str_detect(level, "Very favorably") |
      str_detect(level, "Somewhat favorably"))             ~ "Favourable",
   str_detect(level, "Unfamiliar")                         ~ "Unfamiliar",
   TRUE                                                    ~ "None"
   )) %>% 
  mutate(sub_level = factor(sub_level, levels = c("Favourable", 
                                                  "Neutral", "Unfavourable", 
                                                  "Unfamiliar"))) 

# Processing to setup the waffle plot
# We want to understand each character's popularity
character_info <- character_info %>% 
  select(respondent_id, name, sub_level) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  mutate(n = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(name, sub_level) %>% 
  mutate(
    nn = n(),
    perc = nn / n * 100.0) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(name, sub_level, n, nn, perc) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  inner_join(character_info) %>% 
  select(respondent_id:respondent_gender, name, 
         survey_id, level, sub_level:perc, gender:year)
```

We'll create a waffle plot to have a look at how popular the characters are.
In a few cases the overall percentage is slightly less than 100%. This is due to 
rounding quirks.

```{r, out.width = "110%", out.height = "110%"}
# remotes::install_github("hrbrmstr/waffle")
library(waffle)

character_info %>% 
  select(name, sub_level, perc) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill = sub_level, values = perc %>% round())) +
  geom_waffle(colour = "white", n_rows = 10, size = 0.33,
              pad = 1, flip = FALSE,
              make_proportional = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~ name) +
  labs(title = "Popularity of Star Wars Characters",
       subtitle = "Among US respondents who consider themselves Star Wars Fans",
       x = "1 square = 1%",
       fill = "")  +
  theme(legend.position="bottom", 
        panel.spacing = unit(1, "lines"),
        strip.background = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())

# Check: 
# rounding causing waffle to not be fully filled
character_info %>% 
  select(name, sub_level, perc) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  filter(name == "Lando Calrissian")
```

## Done? Remember to disconnect!

```{r}
# Good housekeeping means disconnect
dbDisconnect(con)
```
